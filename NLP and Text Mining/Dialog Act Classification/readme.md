### 2. Introduction

In this task, I used Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus (SwDA) to develop a dialog act classifier that can differentiate three types of dialog act -- **i.e., starting conversation, closing conversation, and info request** -- from all other types of dialog act. Since these three of types of dialog act are the most common types of dialog act people interact with amachine conversation system, the ability to correctly notice and 
differentiate those dialog acts is crucial for a successful machine conversation system. This is the basic reasoning why we want to develop a classifier which aims to differentiate those three types of dialog act.
