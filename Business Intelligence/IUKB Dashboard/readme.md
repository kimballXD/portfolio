### 2. Introduction

[KB Dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/1-L-U-sZUb5XXmHi4oEhGIF4sIzFNnETO/page/Clw5) is a website usage dashboard of [Indiana University Knowledge Base](https://kb.iu.edu/) domain.

As showed in the system architecture graph, the dashboard applies many functionality of Google Data Board, such as data blending (essentially "left join" in database system), calculated fields, and data filtering, to achieve current dashboard features. 

The publish of KB dashboard greatly helps the internal users (i.e., users of Indiana University) to access to the previous inaccessible Google Analytics data and to find out how their contents perform through self-service. On the other hand, it also frees the staff's of Indiana University Knowledge Base the burden of recurrently providing web usage data to the countless content providers, directives and leaderships. The dashboard is a great example that how business intelligence technologies and improve the productivity and knowledge spread through the organization.
