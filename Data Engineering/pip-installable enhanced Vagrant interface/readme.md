### 2. Introduction

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a open-source software that help users to build and manage virtual machines through command line. Built upon Vagrant,`ehvagrant`provide users an *enhanced* command line interface that enable users to utilize Vagrant functionalities *in an earlier way*. `ehvagrant`, in essence, is an pip-installable python script. Thanks to the "entry_points" functionality supported by [setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools), we can easily use this script as if it is a "real" command line application.
